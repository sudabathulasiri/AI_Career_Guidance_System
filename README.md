def calculate_career_match(user_scores):
    for career, required_traits in CAREER_DATABASE.items():
        match_score = 0
        for trait, required_level in required_traits.items():
            user_level = user_scores[trait] / 5.0  # Normalize to 0-1
            trait_match = 1 - abs(user_level - required_level)
            match_score += trait_match
        
        career_score = match_score / len(required_traits)
    return sorted_career_scores
